### Technical Overview
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

It is following [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) guidelines with the following changes:
* There are no "Organisms" components.
* Atoms and Molecules are not state-aware (do not know MobX store exist)
* Templates and Pages are state-aware
* Molecules may contain other Molecules or Atoms. Atoms does not contain other Atoms.

2rd Party libraries included:
* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
* [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) - using [react-mobx-lite](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-lite) with [hooks](https://mobx-react.js.org/libraries)
* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
* [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* [React-Vis](https://uber.github.io/react-vis/) - Graphs Data Visualization Components

### Contribution Guidelines
Branch naming convention is as following
```
TYPE(ISSUE_ID)-DESCRIPTION

examples:
feat(113)-add-newsflash-location-on-map
fix(114)-newsflash-location-not-accurate
```
When `TYPE` can be:
* **feat** - is a new feature
* **doc** - documentation only changes
* **cicd** - changes related to CI/CD system
* **fix** - a bug fix
* **refactor** -  code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

**All PRs must include commit message with the changes description!**

Branching system:
*master* - used for production <br>
*development* - anything else <br>
A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:
1. `git pull development`
2. Create new branch from `development` , like: `refactor(137)-making-pie-chart-generic-component`
3. Work - commit - repeat
4. Push branch and open PR to `development`.
5. Get a code review approval / reject
6. After approval, merge your PR
7. Delete your branch after merge

See [API document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hv5ItvwM3z9nn95LjlsYHL-o18V8PgWrrQOKIPiPymU)

### CICD <a id="cicd"></a> 
We use [github actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) for the following flows:

1. [on-push CI](https://github.com/hasadna/anyway-newsflash-infographics/actions?query=workflow%3ACI) - provide per-PR CI testing
2. [deploy-development](https://github.com/hasadna/anyway-newsflash-infographics/actions?query=workflow%3Adeploy-development) continous deployment of `development` branch to https://anyway-newsflash-infographics.web.app/
3. [deploy-master]() - TBD

Note: see the flows status badge at the top of this file

### About bundle size
Since [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) uses webpack under the hood,
You can safely use [named imports](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-es6-import/36796281#36796281)
when working with [Material UI components](https://material-ui.com/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/#how-to-reduce-the-bundle-size).


### VScode prettier
If you're using VScode prettier, please use the following config:
```
{
  "prettier.jsxSingleQuote": true,
  "javascript.preferences.quoteStyle": "single",
  "typescript.preferences.quoteStyle": "single",
  "prettier.singleQuote": true
} 
```
## Mock Server 
Mock server can be found under https://anyway-mock-server.herokuapp.com/api.
The server caching all responses from each unique request.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run sb`
